# Spam vs. Ham Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on building a binary classifier to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails. It is divided into two parts, each designed to provide hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building and evaluating machine learning models using the `sklearn` library.

## Project Structure
### Part 1: Initial Analysis and Logistic Regression
- Introduces text feature engineering and logistic regression.
- Analyzes the spam/ham data, builds initial features, and assesses model accuracy.
- Focuses on preventing overfitting for better model generalization.

### Part 2: Custom Spam/Ham Classifier
- Develops a custom classifier to improve email detection accuracy.
- Applies more complex techniques to achieve robust spam filtering.

## Key Skills Practiced
- **Feature engineering** with text data
- **Text preprocessing** techniques using `sklearn`
- **Building and validating** machine learning models
- **Minimizing overfitting** for improved generalization
